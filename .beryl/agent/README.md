# Agent Control Plane

This directory is the canonical source of truth for agent behavior in this repository.

## Why this exists

The system follows the core rule from `Plan.md`: generation speed is useful only when deterministic feedback loops are stronger than the generation loop. These files make that rule executable.

## Folder model

<p align="center">
  <img src="../../assets/beryl-agent-folder-map.png" alt="Beryl agent folder map: one repo-owned control plane for routing, policies, checks, decisions, generated shims, and review evidence" width="960" />
</p>

The important move is ownership: the repository carries the contract, not a chat transcript and not one overloaded markdown file. Routing, policies, checks, architecture context, and decisions live together so each agent session can reload the same working agreement before it edits code.

## Source of truth model

1. `.beryl/agent/` files are canonical.
2. Tool-specific instruction files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/agent-rules.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.codex/AGENTS.md`) are generated shims.
3. Installed projects seed project-owned canonical files from `.beryl/agent/templates/install/`; Beryl's own filled-in canonical files are not copied as target project truth.
4. Do not edit generated shims manually. Edit `.beryl/agent/tool-instruction-template.md` and run:

```bash
./.beryl/agent/scripts/sync-agent-env.sh
```

## Bootstrap checklist

Fill these files before feature implementation:

- `project-brief.md`
- `ubiquitous-language.md`
- `design-tree.md`
- `architecture.md`
- `testing-policy.md`
- `agent-rules.md`
- `task-routing.md`

Then run:

```bash
./.beryl/agent/scripts/seed-agent-context.sh
./.beryl/agent/scripts/sync-agent-env.sh
./.beryl/agent/scripts/agent-doctor.sh
./.beryl/scripts/check.sh --development
```

## Test manifest scope

Configure test immutability detection in `.beryl/agent/test-manifest.conf`.

- `INCLUDE_GLOBS`: which test files are tracked
- `EXCLUDE_GLOBS`: ignored paths
- `MANIFEST_PATH`: where the hash manifest is stored

## Decision recording rule

- Use `design-tree.md` for evolving or unresolved design choices.
- Use `.beryl/agent/adr/` when a decision changes durable architecture, boundaries, terminology, data shape, or test strategy.

## Adding skills

Skills live in `.beryl/agent/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, so repo-specific
skills stay with the repository instead of with any one coding agent. Ingest
a skill from a local file, a local directory, or a raw https URL with:

```bash
./.beryl/agent/scripts/add-skill.sh --list
./.beryl/agent/scripts/add-skill.sh reviewing-migrations --from ./drafts/migrations-skill.md
./.beryl/agent/scripts/add-skill.sh reviewing-migrations --from https://example.com/raw/SKILL.md --force
```

The script validates the name and SKILL.md shape, then prints the
registration steps (task-routing entry, optional tool-instruction-template
mention, `sync-agent-env.sh` re-run).

## Skill naming alias

- `grill-me` is the shorthand alias.
- `grill-me` is the canonical skill contract.
- `interview-me` is the user-interview fallback for unresolved `grill-me` decisions.

## Task routing

- `task-routing.md` maps the user's current intent to one workflow skill.
- Load one task workflow first: `planning`, `initial-build`, `adding-features`, `debugging`, or `explaining-codebase`.
- Feature implementation requires a user-ratified plan. If no approved plan exists, plan first and stop.
- Feature-slice bookkeeping is internal and temporary. Use ignored `session-state.md` only when needed for resume.
- Use sub-agents only when the user explicitly asks for them.
- Keep debugging error history session-scoped and bounded in `session-state.md`.

## Context hygiene

- Keep temporary implementation state out of canonical files.
- Clear `.beryl/agent/session-state.md` after a feature is complete.
- Promote only durable decisions to `design-tree.md`, `architecture.md`, `ubiquitous-language.md`, or `adr/`.

## Initial Builds

Explicit large or greenfield application requests use
`.beryl/agent/skills/initial-build/SKILL.md`. The workflow discovers the
repository, asks clarification questions one at a time, proposes a hierarchical
dependency plan, and waits for user ratification before editing the build.

After ratification it creates the Git-tracked but transient
`.beryl/agent/hierarchy.md`. The hierarchy records node ids, parents,
dependencies, deliverables, checks, statuses, evidence, and canonical context
targets. It is the active build's source of truth and allows later sessions to
resume. Durable decisions are promoted to canonical Markdown as the build
progresses; the hierarchy is deleted only when every node and required check
passes. Ordinary feature work does not create this file.
